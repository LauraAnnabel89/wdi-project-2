A Cut Above the Rest ------

Aim

To have an authenticated multi-page website showing the best barbers in London with a great user-journey and lifestyle feel.

User Journey

- Log in or register
- Home page renders with nav bar Above
- User has the options of the map, all the barbers, editorial or to log out
- Map shows pins for all barbers and an info window
- Barbers shows all the barbers in a grid, with modals showing more detailed information, a picture and link to the website
- Editorial shows an inspiration page with clickable modals and blog pieces
- User can then log out and will be taken back to the sign in/register page








Problems & Challenges

- The data testing side took longer than anticipated
I spent the first few days trying out a range of APIs and had to change my whole idea three times, meaning I started from scratch on Monday
My code is a STATE!!!
Modifying dynamically created elements proved tricky
Adapting bootstrap objects was difficult
I got more than a little div-crazy
